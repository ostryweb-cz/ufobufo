His interest in art, music and nature was awakened in his early years. At the age of 14 Peter became deeply influenced by the energy of electronic sounds. It was revealed in a collection of contemporary music and the study of new rhythms. Peter’s first psy-trance experience was in Carpathian Mountains in 2001. Being inspired by new feelings, magic energy and great psy-trance experience. He started Djing psychedelic music, organizing parties and art projects together with Ukrainian promo group TranceCarpathiArts. His Dj career started in 2003 in Ukraine and has grown into constant bookings in other countries. It has broadened his vision of psy-culture existence and inspired Peter for self-development and perfection. Petrix’s passion was revealed through experiments with different psychedelic styles and he has always kept a unique sound and energy for his dj sets, which are deep hallucinogenic stories filled with tribal sounds over a powerful rhythmic base - in the night time light and peaceful, leaving the funkiest tales for the morning.",

One year later he attended his first electronic dance party and his interests turned toward contemporary electronic music.<br><br>When his band splitted up, he got a computer and started to create his own sounds with acoustic and electronic instruments such as guitars, percussions, synths, and of course the computer. His first tracks were trance, dub, breakbeat and jazzy jungle tunes.<br><br>In the same time he and his friends founded a party promoter and dj collective project called Alapzaj (Basic Noise). The group was a significant point in the underground techno scene of Budapest.<br><br>The firstly released track (a remix of the famous Hungarian band, Korai Öröm, 1998) was soon followed by others on several compilations.<br><br>By this time he had deepened in psychedelic trance and concentrated on producing quality psychedelic music.<br><br>In 2000 he gave his first live act in an open air party in Hungary, in the same year he released a dub track on the first professional label, Chi Recordings. In the next year he went to Austria to play his first performance abroad. His unique style was highly appreciated so he become a well-known artist in Hungary. More and more realeses and gigs came, and that time he realised that making musical fusions are the most important things in creating new sounds so he started to mix genres in a tasty manner.<br><br>His first international big success was his live act on legendary Boom Festival in 2004 in Portugal, where 20 000 people gathered to see the best trance artists of the world.",

First time he had contact with psytrance about 1997, when he heard the recordings of Juno Reactor. At the beginning of his adventure with electronic music, he derived recordings and knowledge from the already non-existent broadcasting station Evosonic and broadcast \"Technikum Mechanizacji Muzyki\" on the radio RMF. With the growing number of events were widening his connections. At DJ Dudi's instigation Styropian bought his first vinyls and on 12 October 2002 made his debut at the event \"Psychedelic Experience\" in a small club \"Tarantula\" in Bytom. Less than a year later joined to the team Psytrance.pl. At the turn of 2004/2005 set up collective - Psylesia Crew, which every two months organize the event in a series \"..... Tales \" in the INQbator Club in Katowice. Since 2005 is a frequent guest at events in different cities in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia.",

They devoted many nights to weird musical experimentation, most of the time in Raz notorious apartment. Throughout this crazy time the friends (now including Alex C & Linus Z) created the chill-out project \"Spooky minds\" from a few sessions with a unique sound every time since everything was completely improvised. Unfortunately there's nothing recorded from this time (or is it… ;-), but a lot of psychedelic memories remain, and of course they live through the project today.<br><br>After finishing school, Ludde left Kristianstad and worked as a freelance illustrator and wrote pianomusic. At the same time music-destiny brought Raz and Collin together. Collin had at this point done tracker techno for many years on his home PC. Of course they met each other at a party! When the common passions started falling into place they decided to put their resources together. Beside the computer, Raz was also a lucky owner of a KORG MS-20. His skills in creating warm analogue noises fitted right in (the MS-20 was of course something prominent in the Spooky minds sound as well). In a basement, in a room with cosy concrete walls, the first fragments of the Etnoscope studio became reality. In the MIDI-based studio Raz & Collin produced their first trance pieces in the name of Etnoscope. Some of the releases of today actually have their essence from these early tracks.<br><br>In the fall of 99, Ludde and Raz met a few times on common friends parties, and the music-discussions were obvious. So when Ludde came back to Sweden in early 2000 after a few months travelling in Africa, he visited Raz & Collin in Kristianstad. Instantly some funky sessions were recorded. Everybody felt that this was something to work with, after a few more amazingly tight sessions team Etnoscope became. 3 completely different individuals complementing each other very well and after playing live a few times they decided to go for this concept for real and try to strike a deal.<br><br>The Etnoscope studio is continually developing with new hardware and Live instruments in symbiosis with hardware and software processing. As a result of this the process looks a bit different from the early days. The typical etnoscope sound comes from the process of working with the actual sound more then the sequencing.",

In 2005 Liam Dorff joined the project as a third member. The trio have known each other since they first met at a party called \"Tugga Metall\" in their hometown Kristianstad in 1999. They have many good memories that connect them together, also in close connection with the already critically acclaimed project Etnoscope. Jesper Nilsson then went for a musical break for about 18 months, but then came back to the group to produce tracks together again.<br><br>The reason to choose \"Pusherstreet\" as the title for this project is connected to the danish freetown Christiania - PusherStreet is the name of a street inmidst that district. Christiania used to be an open community with a tolerant culture, friendly people and a lively vibe, in other words, a very nice place to be. However, the danish government never wanted to accept this little city and despite having kind of tolerated it in the past, over the last years it has become harder and harder for Christiania to survive. The classical Pusher Street with its little shops and charming life had to close and meanwhile the whole area is in danger to be practically run over with construction sites under the fake-fancy coat of \"restructuring\" the place with modern architecture, when in truth the only motivation behind it is the money for the housing in the area!<br><br>Since Rasmus, Liam and Jesper have had really good memories from that place and know the trouble Christiania is in nowadays, they have decided to name their music project Pusherstreet as an honor to the good old times and to capture and preserve the vibe of this little city. And this can also be heard in the music. \"Join us a walk down Pusherstreet\" is one of their catchphrases.<br><br>However, this is not the only motivation behind their sound. Since the trio has observed the progress and development in the psychedelic trance scene and has witnessed that the sound overall turned from its originality and funky variety to a sort of unninovative collage where often the only choice a listener has is to either go for all-the-same-sounding fullon or for off-the-mill progressive, not forgetting that many parties have turned all the way more commercial over time. To be fair, one has to admit that there is still a certain number of really good artists, however, after some time they discovered they're practically listening to the same handful of artists over and over again. They felt that the music has basically lost its freshness and its fun. And that's why they decided to found this project, to bring back the originality, creativity and pulsating positivity that trance music used to be known for!<br><br>And so they created their own new, fresh, funky and biting progressive sound that is easily accesible and goes straight to the heart, making people dance. Free of commerciality and fake-emotionality that unfortunately have infected parts of the trance scene of today they created their \"Umpa Umpa, with a twist\"-sound to bring back the positivity and the fun within progressive trance!",

In the past years he constantly improved his musical and technical knowledge, and over the time he developed an own unique style of true psychedelic night and day music… this style is mainly noticeable by the mixture of various elements from different styles, its not dark, nor is it fluffy, its not full on and not just groovy, its a bit from everything in on. Combined with energetic rolling basslines and pseudo-acoustic effects, not heard before, his live sets deliver a unforgettable listening experience for your minds and bodies.<br><br>In last years, he released 2 trance-albums and one downbeat-album on his own label littleBIGsensations and some more tracks on various compilations on different labels.

After leaving music school as teenager he started to focus more on new forms of music, listening punk, hip hop and downbeats and he made his first experiences as a Dj.<br><br>When he got infected with Goatrance in middle of the nineties, he first started to focus his energy on the visual aspect of trance-events though, and was one of the founders of the meanwhile widely known decoteam Cosmic Walkers. From 1998 he then also got involved in the music, and played his first trance-dj-sets as Boscow.<br><br>Around 2004 he finally began to produce music in various styles, but focused mainly on Psychedelic trance, Ambient and experimental Electronica. In the past years he constantly improved his musical and technical knowledge, and over the time he developed an own unique style of true psychedelic night and day music… this style is mainly noticeable by the mixture of various elements from different styles, its not dark, nor is it fluffy, its not full on and not just groovy, its a bit from everything in on. Combined with energetic rolling basslines and pseudo-acoustic effects, not heard before, his live sets deliver a unforgettable listening experience for your minds and bodies.<br><br>In last years, he released 2 trance-albums and one downbeat-album on his own label littleBIGsensations and some more tracks on various compilations on different labels. He is also producing Psytrance under the synonym of AodioiboA and Downtempo tunes as Waterling.",

My first steps with a guitar in my hand lead through folk&country music, shortly after that i started playing classical guitar. Later on i also played the keyboards and percussions in a live band.<br><br>It didn’t take long and i discovered electronic sounds and started exploring how to make some myself. I got a little MS-DOS based tracker called Tetramed, loaded up some 8-bit samples and filled all 4 available tracks with them! The software and hardware changed over the years, but not the passion. Musical styles didn’t matter to me, i’ve gone through d’n'b, breakbeat, trance, dub, house, industrial, ambient, and everthing in between. The change happened in 2000. Got into psytrance and couldn’t get out, so i stayed in and released some tracks on Ketuh Records. Response was good, more releases followed. I started playing at parties around Europe, then i moved to Sydney to study sound engineering at SAE for a few years.<br><br>My first official album was released during this period on Wirikuta Recordings. Music comes out of my computer, my only role being not to screw it up. It likes being driven by layers of atmospheric textures interlacing and weaving a way for an experienced and attentive listener. It has never been speed-driven.<br><br>2010 is the year of my second album, Made of Clay, released on Parvati Records.",

After leaving music school as teenager he started to focus more on new forms of music, listening punk, hip hop and downbeats and he made his first experiences as a Dj.<br><br>When he got infected with Goatrance in middle of the nineties, he first started to focus his energy on the visual aspect of trance-events though, and was one of the founders of the meanwhile widely known decoteam Cosmic Walkers. From 1998 he then also got involved in the music, and played his first trance-dj-sets as Boscow.<br><br>Around 2004 he finally began to produce music in various styles, but focused mainly on Psychedelic trance, Ambient and experimental Electronica. In the past years he constantly improved his musical and technical knowledge, and over the time he developed an own unique style of true psychedelic night and day music… this style is mainly noticeable by the mixture of various elements from different styles, its not dark, nor is it fluffy, its not full on and not just groovy, its a bit from everything in on. Combined with energetic rolling basslines and pseudo-acoustic effects, not heard before, his live sets deliver a unforgettable listening experience for your minds and bodies.<br><br>In last years, he released 2 trance-albums and one downbeat-album on his own label littleBIGsensations and some more tracks on various compilations on different labels. He is also producing Psytrance under the synonym of AodioiboA and Holikao.",

Hodně ho v té době ovlivnily projekty jako Depeche Mode, Front 242, Technotronic, KLF, Kraftwerk atd. S hraním na flétnu přestal a začal se sousedem dělat první pokusy s automatickým bubeníkem Roland a klávesami Kawaii. Za maturitu dostal zvukovku, přikoupil si klávesy CS1 X a začal se o tvorbu pokoušet znovu. To poslouchal spíše hiphop, triphop, acid, techno, rave a tehdy čím dál rychleji rostoucí drum and bass. Aktuálně, po určité tvůrčí pauze, se pohybuje spíše na poli breakz a funky, ale prvky drumandbass jsou v jeho tvorbě stále cítit.",

It was revealed in a collection of contemporary music and the study of new rhythms. Peter’s first psy-trance experience was in Carpathian Mountains in 2001. Being inspired by new feelings, magic energy and great psy-trance experience. He started Djing psychedelic music, organizing parties and art projects together with Ukrainian promo group TranceCarpathiArts.

It has broadened his vision of psy-culture existence and inspired Peter for self-development and perfection. Petrix’s passion was revealed through experiments with different psychedelic styles and he has always kept a unique sound and energy for his dj sets, which are deep hallucinogenic stories filled with tribal sounds over a powerful rhythmic base - in the night time light and peaceful, leaving the funkiest tales for the morning.",
